# RuForge — notes for IDE agents (Cursor / automation)

Concise context for agents working **inside this repo’s IDE workspace**. This is **not** a full architecture audit; use it as an onboarding + guardrails doc.

## Product scope (read before suggesting features)

**North star:** the **downloader** — reliable YouTube + local handling, **persistent downloads**, resumability/caching where it matters, and **performance**. Treat player, gallery, and polish as supporting that story, not a reason to chase general-purpose media apps.

**What we ship today (mental model):**

- **Inputs:** YouTube URLs and **user-provided video files** (library path / uploads). Expect **rough edges on extensions and casing** (e.g. iPhone `*.MP4` vs `*.mp4`) until scan/filter logic is tightened — fix when touched, but do not re-scope the product around “every container on earth.”
- **Player:** so people can **watch what they already downloaded**; it is not the competitive wedge.
- **Media view:** a **convenient** local library surface on top of downloaded (and scanned) files — secondary to downloader quality.
- **In-app explorer webview:** primarily for **cookie / session flows** that yt-dlp needs (age-restricted, members-only, etc.). It is **not** positioned as a full in-app browser for casual watching. A **uBlock** payload may exist under `src-tauri` for this webview; treat it as **experimental / not relied upon** until it is verified working end-to-end.

**How to advise:** ground recommendations in **what RuForge already is** and what is **already solved well elsewhere** (generic browsers, dedicated players, Plex-like libraries). Avoid **feature creep** and “compete with X” pivots unless the maintainer explicitly widens scope. Longer roadmap, priorities, and out-of-scope list live in the **planning doc** linked below — prefer that over inventing new product direction in chat.

## Planning & ideas (canonical doc)

- **Living roadmap / ideas (outside this git repo):**  
  `c:\Random things i dont want deleted\markdown files\RuForge.md`  
  Open it from Explorer or paste the path in the editor. When work completes, **update that file** (or ask the maintainer to) so IDE agents and humans share one source of truth.
- **In-repo machine plans:** `.cursor/plans/` (e.g. Zustand migration audit) — implementation detail, may lag; trust code + this `AGENTS.md` for “what shipped.”

## Who does what (this workspace vs elsewhere)

| Role | Environment | Scope |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Chad** (default agent in Cursor) | Cursor, this workspace | **Logic only:** TypeScript / React behavior, state, Tauri wiring, bug fixes, refactors. Small `.ts` / `.tsx` edits are in scope when they touch behavior, types, or data flow—not pure styling passes. |
| **Jim** (Gemini) | Your CLI or Antigravity—**not** Cursor | **Visuals only:** layout, typography, color, motion, component styling. **No** business logic, state machines, or store changes. |

**Handoff rule:** If something needs Jim’s pass (pure UI polish), Chad should **not** pretend to be Jim. Instead, Chad ends with a **short, copy-paste prompt for you to run in Jim’s environment** (file paths, desired look, explicit “do not change logic or props contracts”). Chad implements or preserves the logic and prop surfaces Jim should style against.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind v4, Zustand (`src/store/ruforgeStore.ts` + `ruforgePersistStorage.ts`).
- **Desktop:** Tauri v2 (`src-tauri/`), WebView2 on Windows. **Two windows:** `main` (full app) and `mini` (mini player); optional `explorer` webview.
- **Cross-window sync:** Zustand does **not** span webviews. Use existing Tauri **`emit` / `listen`** (`play-media`, `stop-playback`, `send-to-main`, `play-in-mini`, etc.) as the only bridge between main and mini.

## Quick audit snapshot (maintenance-oriented)

- **Source of truth (main window):** `useRuforgeStore` holds nav, settings, paths, notifications, downloader fields, gallery list (`entries` + loading flags), player file/playlist/volume/loop, sidebar, search, explorer URL, etc. Persisted slice is settings + output paths (`ruforgePersistStorage.ts` — flat `localStorage` keys preserved for MiniPlayer and other readers).
- **`App.tsx`:** Still uses **local React state** for window chrome / shell only, e.g. **`isMini`** (which webview label you’re in) and **`isMaximized`** for custom titlebar controls—intentional separation from Zustand.
- **Live gallery UI:** **`MediaView`** (used from `App.tsx`) is aligned with the store’s gallery slice. **`GalleryView.tsx`** exists but is **not** imported by `App.tsx`; treat it as legacy / candidate for delete or future wiring—not part of the shipped Zustand path.
- **`MiniPlayer.tsx`:** Own webview → **duplicated playback UI state** (current file, progress, hover, etc.) synchronized via Tauri events + some `localStorage` keys; do not expect the main window store to appear here.
- **Heavy local `useState` in `PlayerView`:** Normal for playback UI (scrubber, menus, transient controls); not a “migration gap” by itself.

## Zustand migration — are we “done”?

**Functionally, yes for the original intent:** central store + persist, main-window concerns moved off ad-hoc `App` state, mini window still event-driven.

**Not a claim of “every audit bullet closed”:** optional follow-ups (extra gallery caching, housekeeping unused files, deleting or wiring `GalleryView.tsx`) were never strict blockers. If you change gallery loading, prefer **`MediaView` + store** as the real product surface.

**Invariant to respect:** avoid transient pairs like `activeTab === "player"` with `playingFile === null` when subscribers still assume a file (e.g. stop-handlers should clear tab + file atomically for mini-driven stops). Player uses a thin outer shell + inner `PlayerViewWithFile` so hooks stay valid with nullable `playingFile`.

## Versions (keep aligned)

These should match for releases and for sane updater behavior:

- `package.json` → `version`
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `version`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` → `[package] version` (and `Cargo.lock` updates when the crate version changes)

A past mismatch was **`Cargo.toml` behind the JS/Tauri app version** — fix on every bump.

## Auto-updater (Tauri plugin-updater)

- Config: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `plugins.updater` (`endpoints`, `pubkey`). Bundles: `"createUpdaterArtifacts": true`.
- Permissions: `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` includes `updater:allow-check` and `updater:allow-download-and-install`.
- **Runtime:** `src/App.tsx` calls `check()` on startup; update toasts use `downloadAndInstall()` from the returned `Update` object.
- **Why “no update” is often correct:** `check()` returns **`null` unless the version in `updater.json` is greater than the running app’s version.** If `updater.json` on `main` still says the same version as the installed build, users will see nothing — that is expected, not a broken wire.
- **Shipping a new version users can receive:** bump app version, build **signed** artifacts, publish GitHub Release assets, then update **`updater.json`** on `main` with new `version`, `pub_date`, per-platform `url`, and **`signature`** (from the `.sig` files next to each installer — see below). Mismatch between signing key and embedded `pubkey` breaks installs.
- **GitHub `url` vs tag:** the path segment after `releases/download/` must match the **exact** release tag (including a leading `v` if you use `v0.1.2`). A typo or wrong tag yields **404** and “update failed” in the app.

### Signed Windows build (this machine’s layout)

Keys live under **`%USERPROFILE%\.tauri\`** (e.g. `ruforge.key` private, `ruforge.key.pub` public). **Never commit** the private key or paste it into docs/chat logs.

**Before building:** confirm `plugins.updater.pubkey` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` matches the **public** key material (minisign format). Example check in PowerShell (read-only):

```powershell
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.tauri\ruforge.key.pub" -Raw
```

**Environment for `npm run tauri build`:**

```powershell
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY = Get-Content -Raw "$HOME\.tauri\ruforge.key"
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "<password-if-key-is-encrypted>"
npm run tauri build
```

Omit `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` if the key has no password.

**One-click local signed build (Windows, no Git push):** run `Build-signed-windows.bat` from the repo root, or `npm run build:signed`. Script loads `%USERPROFILE%\.tauri\ruforge.key`, sets signing env vars, runs `npm run tauri build`, then prints paths under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`. Optional password file **`.tauri-signing-password`** (single line, gitignored) avoids typing each run. To recreate a **Desktop shortcut** to the batch file, run once: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/create-desktop-shortcut.ps1`.

**After a successful release build**, Tauri writes **one `.sig` per bundle** next to the installer, for example:

- `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\RuForge_<version>_x64_en-US.msi.sig`
- `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\RuForge_<version>_x64-setup.exe.sig`

Copy the **base64 signature** from each `.sig` into `updater.json` for the matching platform entry. Use the CLI / docs for your exact updater JSON shape if it changes between Tauri releases.

**Frontend bundle:** `npm run build` may warn when a JS chunk exceeds ~500 kB; that is a Vite/Rollup heads-up, not a signing issue. Address with code-splitting when it becomes a priority.

## Builds

- **Web bundle only:** `npm run build` (runs `tsc` + `vite build`).
- **Desktop installer:** `npm run tauri build` (after frontend build per `beforeBuildCommand`).

## Git / large binaries

- **`src-tauri/binaries/ffmpeg-*` and `ffprobe-*`** are very large (~hundreds of MB). Do **not** commit them unless the project explicitly uses Git LFS or a documented policy. **`yt-dlp-*`** is smaller and may already be tracked.
- Typical junk to exclude unless intended: `.cursor/`, ad-hoc archives like `ffmpeg.7z`.

## Product / UX pointers (from recent work)

- **Playback persistence:** `src/playbackStorage.ts` — furthest position + stored duration for progress/watched when catalog `duration` is still 0; thumbnail bars use `getPlaybackThumbnailBar`.
- **Mini player:** transparent undecorated window; clip-path + control bar behavior affects perceived corners; “back to app” should focus `main` before closing mini.
- **Player:** main `PlayerView` uses opacity dip + no remounting `key` on `<video>` to reduce flash when auto-advancing; folder queue first, then library sorted list for advance when settings allow.

## When unsure

- Prefer reading **`ruforgeStore.ts`**, **`App.tsx`**, **`MiniPlayer.tsx`**, and **`tauri.conf.json`** before large refactors.
- For updater or signing behavior, trust **current Tauri v2 + plugin-updater docs** over memory; the surface changes over time.
